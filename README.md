# Duplicate Document Detection

## Overview

Duplicate document detection is a critical challenge in the realms of information management and text mining. As the volume of available information continues to grow exponentially, both online and in corporate environments, there's an ever-increasing demand for precise and efficient tools to identify duplicated documents or those sharing similar content.

This need for duplicate document detection spans across multiple domains, including academic plagiarism prevention, database organization and deduplication, legal document management, and the elimination of duplicates in search engines and information repositories. In these contexts, the ability to swiftly pinpoint duplicate or closely related documents is paramount, as it not only saves time and resources but also ensures the quality of the information at hand.

This Master's Thesis project is dedicated to exploring the application of vector similarity search techniques to tackle the document deduplication problem. The primary objective is to devise a robust and efficient approach for identifying duplicated documents within extensive textual datasets. This is achieved by utilizing machine learning models to represent documents within a vector space, enabling the calculation of similarities between them.

## Key Objectives

- Develop a robust and efficient approach for detecting duplicated documents within large textual datasets.
- Utilize machine learning models to represent documents in a vector space.
- Calculate similarities between documents to identify duplicates or similar content.
- Address document deduplication challenges in academic, legal, and corporate environments.
